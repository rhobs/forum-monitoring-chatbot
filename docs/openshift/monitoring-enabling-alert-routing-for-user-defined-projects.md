# Enabling alert routing for user-defined projects

In OpenShift, an administrator can enable alert routing for user-defined projects.
This process consists of the following steps:

* Enable alert routing for user-defined projects:
__ Use the default platform Alertmanager instance.
__ Use a separate Alertmanager instance only for user-defined projects.

* Enable alert routing for user-defined projects to use a separate Alertmanager instance.

* Grant users permission to configure alert routing for user-defined projects.

After you complete these steps, developers and other users can configure custom alerts and alert routing for their user-defined projects.
